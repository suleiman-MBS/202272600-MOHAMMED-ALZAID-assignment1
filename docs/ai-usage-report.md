# AI Usage Report

## 1. Tools Used
- **AI Assistant:** Google Gemini (used for troubleshooting, command guidance, code structure, content refinement, and assignment clarification).
- **Development Environment:** VS Code (IDE), Command Prompt (Terminal), and Git.

## 2. Use Cases & Interaction
I used Gemini primarily as a technical tutor and guide. It helped me navigate the technical setup and, crucially, helped me verify that my work aligned with the assignment's grading rubric.

### Key Areas of Assistance:
1.  **Repository Setup:** I asked for help on how to clone my GitHub repository to my local machine using the Command Prompt.
2.  **Git Troubleshooting:** I encountered errors such as "Please tell me who you are" and "nothing to commit." Gemini explained that I needed to configure my `user.name` and `user.email` and explained the concept of "Staging" files before committing.
3.  **Project Structure:** I used AI to generate the initial folder structure (css, js, assets) and the boilerplate HTML/CSS code to ensure I met the assignment requirements.
4.  **Content Refinement (README):** I provided my raw resume data to Gemini to structure a professional `README.md` that highlights my academic background (KFUPM), GPA, and specific technical skills (Splunk, AFL++) rather than using generic placeholder text.
5.  **Requirement Clarification:** I was unsure if the actual HTML/CSS web page files were strictly necessary or if the repository structure was enough. I asked Gemini to review the assignment file (`portfolio assignment-1.md`) and the grading rubric. It clarified that the "Technical Implementation" (the working website) accounts for 40% of the grade, ensuring I didn't submit an incomplete assignment.

### Example Prompts:
- *"how to get clone with my computer?"*
- *"why i can not commit? it says log in to git..."*
- *"is haveing a wep page as what you did really matter the assignment?"*

## 3. Benefits & Challenges
- **Benefits:** The AI acted as a tutor, explaining *why* errors were happening rather than just fixing them silently. It also acted as a safeguard, reviewing the assignment instructions to ensure I didn't miss critical grading criteria (like the 40% weight on Functionality).
- **Challenges:** Sometimes the AI assumed I was using the terminal when I was looking at the VS Code GUI, or vice-versa, so I had to clarify which interface I was using.

## 4. Learning Outcomes
Through this process, I learned:
- How to link a local folder to a remote GitHub repository.
- The importance of `git config` for identifying the author of changes.
- The difference between "Staging" a file and "Committing" a file.
- How to present professional bio information using Markdown formatting.
- How to interpret a technical grading rubric to prioritize development tasks (e.g., focusing on responsiveness because it is worth 10 points).
