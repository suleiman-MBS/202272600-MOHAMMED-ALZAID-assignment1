# AI Usage Report

## 1. Tools Used
- **AI Assistant:** Google Gemini (used for troubleshooting, command guidance, and code structure).
- **Development Environment:** VS Code (IDE), Command Prompt (Terminal), and Git.

## 2. Use Cases & Interaction
I used Gemini primarily as a technical guide to help me navigate the Git workflow and repository setup.

### Key Areas of Assistance:
1.  **Repository Setup:** I asked for help on how to clone my GitHub repository to my local machine using the Command Prompt.
2.  **Git Troubleshooting:** I encountered errors such as "Please tell me who you are" and "nothing to commit." Gemini explained that I needed to configure my `user.name` and `user.email` and explained the concept of "Staging" files before committing.
3.  **Project Structure:** I used AI to generate the initial folder structure (css, js, assets) and the boilerplate HTML/CSS code to ensure I met the assignment requirements.

### Example Prompts:
- *"how to get clone with my computer?"*
- *"why i can not commit? it says log in to git..."*
- *"why when i click commit it says nothing to commit?"*

## 3. Benefits & Challenges
- **Benefits:** The AI acted as a tutor, explaining *why* errors were happening (like the empty folder issue) rather than just fixing them silently. It helped me learn the Git commands (`git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`) step-by-step.
- **Challenges:** Sometimes the AI assumed I was using the terminal when I was looking at the VS Code GUI, or vice-versa, so I had to clarify which interface I was using.

## 4. Learning Outcomes
Through this process, I learned:
- How to link a local folder to a remote GitHub repository.
- The importance of `git config` for identifying the author of changes.
- The difference between "Staging" a file and "Committing" a file.
- How to create a responsive HTML/CSS structure that adapts to mobile screens.
