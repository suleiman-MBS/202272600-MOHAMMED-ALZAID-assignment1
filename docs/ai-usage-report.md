# AI Usage Report

## 1. Tools Used
- **AI Assistant:** Google Gemini (used for troubleshooting, command guidance, code structure, and content refinement).
- **Development Environment:** VS Code (IDE), Command Prompt (Terminal), and Git.

## 2. Use Cases & Interaction
I used Gemini primarily as a technical guide to help me navigate the Git workflow and repository setup, as well as to refine the professional content of my portfolio.

### Key Areas of Assistance:
1.  **Repository Setup:** I asked for help on how to clone my GitHub repository to my local machine using the Command Prompt.
2.  **Git Troubleshooting:** I encountered errors such as "Please tell me who you are" and "nothing to commit." Gemini explained that I needed to configure my `user.name` and `user.email` and explained the concept of "Staging" files before committing.
3.  **Project Structure:** I used AI to generate the initial folder structure (css, js, assets) and the boilerplate HTML/CSS code to ensure I met the assignment requirements.
4.  **Content Refinement (README):** I provided my raw resume data to Gemini and asked it to structure a professional `README.md` that highlights my academic background (KFUPM), GPA, and specific technical skills (Splunk, AFL++) rather than using generic placeholder text.

### Example Prompts:
- *"how to get clone with my computer?"*
- *"why i can not commit? it says log in to git..."*
- *"i think the readme is not listing who am i... see this small resume which is incomplete"*

## 3. Benefits & Challenges
- **Benefits:** The AI acted as a tutor, explaining *why* errors were happening rather than just fixing them silently. It also helped me translate my raw resume points into a structured Markdown format for the repository documentation.
- **Challenges:** Sometimes the AI assumed I was using the terminal when I was looking at the VS Code GUI, or vice-versa, so I had to clarify which interface I was using.

## 4. Learning Outcomes
Through this process, I learned:
- How to link a local folder to a remote GitHub repository.
- The importance of `git config` for identifying the author of changes.
- The difference between "Staging" a file and "Committing" a file.
- How to present professional bio information using Markdown formatting.
